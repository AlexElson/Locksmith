CSCI 3415: Principles of Programming Languages
Project 4 Grade Sheet, flex and bison

Points Possible	Description
1	5/5	Flex runs without warnings or errors

2	10/10	Bison runs without warnings or errors

3	5/5	C++ code compiles and runs

4	10/10	Monsters and treasures are optional with a Room.

5	10	A Monster's hits and weapon may be provided in either order

6	10/10	The program reads directly from dungeon.txt

7	10/10	After parsing dungeon.txt, the user is able to either print the
                sorted dungeon or exit.

8	10/10	Each call to strdup() in the flex file is matched by a call to
                free() in the bison file

9	10/10	The code uses Monster, Treasure, Room, and Dungeon classes.

10	0/10	Rooms, Treasures, and Monsters allocated by new are released
                using delete in the Dungeon destructor.

11	10/10	The various strings (room description, monster type, etc.) do
                not have any erroneous text (e.g., leading whitespace).
================================================================================
Excellent project, but you didn't release your memory allocated with "new".
